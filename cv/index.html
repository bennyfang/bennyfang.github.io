    <li>Customized Visual Basic macros for Excel to automate data retrieval from server storage and smart fill tables</li>
    <li>Queried data for fire incidents and categorized them into types and years, which was then translated into a heat map presentation on the city website</li>
    <li>Resolved over 50 bugs in the Application Inventory Depository site written in VB.Net to launch it into production</li>
    <li>Designed the Transit Incident Tracking System (see page 2, second project) to address the city’s need for an online, easy-to-use tracking system</li>

	<h1>Programming and Engineering Projects</h1>
	<h2>2015-2016</h2>
    <h3>Team Lead of a Real-time Piano Simulator Project,<br>University of Toronto:</h3>	 
    <li>Handled a project in a team of 4 to recreate authentic piano sound at real time by simulating complex physical piano mechanism rather than simple piano key sampling</li>
    <li>Divided the team into 2 groups: the algorithm team responsible for calculations and research, and the programmer team responsible for software-hardware implementations</li>
    <li>Visualized the piano sound algorithm as a function of time and initial key-strike velocity to simulate the action of the hammer striking the string inside the piano</li>
    <li>Initially ran algorithm in matlab, converting calculated sample sound vectors into a playable sound wave</li>
    <li>Migrated to C++ due to its superior runtime and available means of optimization such as multi-threading and blocking</li>
    <li>Implemented hardware integration with a electric piano via USB ports and programmed generated sound onto each piano key</li>
    <li>Demonstrated design at the annual University of Toronto design fair, allowing users to play with the piano freely while generating sound at real-time as keys were struck</li>
    <h2>2014-2015</h2>
    <h3>Developer of the Transit Incident Tracking Solution,<br>City of Brampton:</h3>
    <li>Approached by the City of Brampton’s Transit Department representative to create a system tracking transit incident records within the City of Brampton</li>
    <li>Designed the system using the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 platform</li>
    <li>Drafted Excel document to outline schematic and relationship information</li>
    <li>Implemented entities and forms to store information entered by the users</li>
    <li>Customized the entities with JavaScript and JQuery to integrate smart forms to auto-fill information, hide and show fields to users with different roles and grey out unnecessary fields based on drop-down options</li>
    <li>Built automated email sender using Microsoft CRM workflows and dialogs</li>
    <li>Held weekly meetings with the client and the project manager for feedbacks</li>
    <li>Presented design to the client and power-users and delivered the system into production</li>
    <h2>2014</h2>

    <li>Engaged in an VR application development project in C# on the Unity platform</li>
    <li>Participated in a group of 3 and was assigned the task to brainstorm project design and elements to implement due to my prior music background</li>
    <li>Created a virtual music player that respond to hand gestures to the sensor camera</li>
    <li>Placed audio player on a virtual 3D plane and scaled music volume to the user’s distance from the player (the sound was strong if user was close and weak if user was far)</li>
    <li>Supported multiple music players and placed audio control buttons to play and stop the music, as well as adjusting the volumes of each player through hand gestures only</li>
    <li>Allowed project to be passed on to future VR developers with drafted technical documentation and packaged libraries</li>
